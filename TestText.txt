Additionally to answer of A.R. please note that if you want to use TextBox to drop you have to know following stuff.

TextBox seems to have already some default handling for DragAndDrop. If your data object is a String, it simply works. Other types are not handled and you get the Forbidden mouse effect and your Drop handler is never called.
